Environmental monitoring using Raspberry Pi B, Raspberry Pi Pico W,
TI SensorTags and BLE ThermoBeacons.

See './MicroPython' for a MicroPython-based solution which uses only
BLE Beacon sensors (i.e. which radiate all important data directly in their Advertsising data).

The files in './INSTALL', './Test/*.py' and the sketches in './Arduino' 
and './Launchpad' might help as a starting point for your own experiments.
(See esp. ./Test/ble_discover.py which provides a complete
characteristic discovery of a BLE device.)
